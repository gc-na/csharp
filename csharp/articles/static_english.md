# Understanding the `static` Keyword in C#: Purpose, Usage, and Examples

## Synopsis
The `static` keyword in C# is used to declare members that belong to the type itself rather than to a specific instance of the type, allowing for shared access and memory efficiency.

## Documentation
In C#, the `static` modifier can be applied to classes, methods, fields, properties, and events. When a member is declared as `static`, it is associated with the class itself, rather than any object instance. This means that:

- **Static Members**: You can access static members using the class name without creating an instance of the class.
- **Memory Management**: Static members are stored in a single memory location and shared across all instances, which can lead to more efficient memory usage.
- **Global Access**: Static members can be accessed globally from anywhere in the application, provided the access modifiers allow it.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `static` keyword is to define members that should be shared across all instances of a class, providing a way to store data or methods that do not rely on instance-specific data.

### Usage
- **Static Classes**: A class declared with the `static` keyword can only contain static members and cannot be instantiated.
- **Static Methods**: These methods can be called on the class itself without needing an object instance.
- **Static Fields**: These fields will maintain their value across all instances of the class.

## Examples

### Example 1: Static Method
```csharp
public class MathUtility
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Usage
int sum = MathUtility.Add(5, 10);
```

### Example 2: Static Field
```csharp
public class Counter
{
    public static int Count { get; private set; } = 0;

    public Counter()
    {
        Count++;
    }
}

// Usage
Counter c1 = new Counter();
Counter c2 = new Counter();
Console.WriteLine(Counter.Count); // Output: 2
```

### Example 3: Static Class
```csharp
public static class Constants
{
    public const double Pi = 3.14159;
}

// Usage
double area = Constants.Pi * radius * radius;
```

## Explanation
While using `static` can be beneficial for memory efficiency and shared access, there are common pitfalls to watch out for:

- **Thread Safety**: Static members can lead to race conditions when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Use appropriate synchronization techniques to manage access.
- **Initialization Order**: Static fields are initialized in the order they are declared. If one static field depends on another, ensure they are initialized in the correct order.
- **Memory Leaks**: Static members can prevent garbage collection if they hold references to large objects or instances, leading to memory leaks.
- **Testability**: Code that relies heavily on static members can be harder to test due to tight coupling. Consider dependency injection for better testability.

## One Line Summary
The `static` keyword in C# allows for the declaration of members that are shared across all instances of a class, providing efficient access and memory management.
